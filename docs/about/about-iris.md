# About - IRIS IAM
The IAM (Identity and Access Manager) provides an Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) solution to [IRIS](https://www.iris.ac.uk/). The IAM acts as a proxy service, allowing IRIS collaborators access to other IRIS services.
## What is IRIS?
STFC supports a diverse set of Science Activities. These activities require a substantial “eInfrastructure” to manage, preserve, analyse and simulate theiruch eInfrastructure includes both the physical infrastructure (HPC and HTC computing resource, disk and tape storage), and the software infrastructure needed to enable the data to be processed.

IRIS is the co-ordinating body for the provision of this eInfrastructure and is a collaboration between STFC, its eInfrastructure Providers and representatives from the Science Activities themselves.
More details of what IRIS is (and indeed what it isn’t) can be found in the IRIS [what is IRIS?](https://www.iris.ac.uk/what-is-iris/) section and in the [IRIS-FAQ](https://www.iris.ac.uk/what-is-iris/faq/).
